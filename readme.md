In 2026, if you want to free yourself from Google Drive or Microsoft 365, self-hosted options remain surprisingly limited. Nextcloud is essentially the only serious choice, with very few real alternatives. DjanCloud was born out of this frustration: an all-in-one, lightweight Nextcloud-compatible server with a 100% Python backend built on Django and a Vue.js frontend, offering the essential features without the complexity of the PHP stack.

What is working so far:

- Login page, user management with simple role.
- Web UI to browse files and folders.
- Simple shared folder
- Login with official Nextcloud client and full synchronisation
- Browsable files over webdav.
- Collaborative markdown editor
- Shared calendars with CalDAV support
- Shared contacts with CardDAV support
- Email client with SMTP and IMAP support

What I'm planning to do:

- Integrate OnlyOffice or Collabora Office

Any requests or pull requests are welcome.

    This is draft project, don't expect to have it running in production !!
